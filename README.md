# Character

Creative AI Beings software for next generation

Character is a personal project, whose goal is to create more intelligent
virtual characters. He or she can talk, sing, dance, write, and more. We
use Character application to create sound and images, and finally generate
videos that can be played. In order to liberate people's productivity,
sound and images will not only use traditional methods, but also use
artificial intelligence to generate them. If you have any questions and
suggestions, you can contact me in [bilibili space](https://space.bilibili.com/3461566190061988).
